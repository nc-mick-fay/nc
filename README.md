This is a brief outline of how a problem may be broken down step-by-step, building a solution gradually, rather than searching for a complete solution without thinking.

To demonstrate this, I have provided the below links, found from the following google searches:
[How to find a list of prime numbers in python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11619942/print-series-of-prime-numbers-in-python)
This gives initial solutions that do not solve our problem, which can be used to demonstrate that it is often not as easy as just searching for an answer

[Finding the square root of a number in python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70793490/how-do-i-calculate-square-root-in-python)
